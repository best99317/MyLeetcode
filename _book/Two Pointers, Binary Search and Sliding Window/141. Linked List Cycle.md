# [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/) [Easy]

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

## **Anaylsis:**
Two pointers serve as a common way of judging whether there is a cycle in the linked list. Declare two pointers, one fast, one slow. The fast one traverse two list nodes at a time whilst the slow one one node at a time. If there is no cycle in the list, the fast pointer should hit the null pointer at the end. If there is, however, the fast pointer should be able to come up with the slow one again through the cycle.

## **Code:**
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode *fast = head;
        ListNode *slow = head;
        while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
            if (fast == slow) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

## **Complexity:**
- If there is no cycle, it would take the fast pointer `n/2` times of moving to reach the end. If there is, when both of the two pointers reach the cycle, the slow pointer would be at the `pos` node, and the fast would be at the `2*pos` node. The chasing distance would be `n-2*pos` and the time needed would also be `n-2*pos` since the speed difference is one node per iteration. Thus, The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`.

- The extra space in this algorithm is used for storing the two pointers, which takes `O(1)` complexity.
