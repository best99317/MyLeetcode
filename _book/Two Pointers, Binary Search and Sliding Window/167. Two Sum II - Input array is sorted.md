# [167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/) [Easy]

Given an array of integers that is already **sorted in ascending order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note:**

- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have *exactly* one solution and you may not use the *same* element twice.

**Example:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

## **Anaylsis:**
It's easy to come up with the brute force algorithm that takes `O(n^2)` time complextiy by adding up all possible pairs. But this algorithm didn't utilize the information that the array is sorted.

The solution can be degraded to `O(n)` complexity by using two pointers. We can start from the first and the last elements of the array. If the sum of the elements is less than the target, we move the first pointer one element right; is greater then we move
the second pointer one element left.

## **Code:**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = numbers.size()-1;
        vector<int> res;
        while (left < right) {
            if (numbers[left] + numbers[right] == target) {
                res = {left+1, right+1};
                break;
            } else if (numbers[left] + numbers[right] >= target) {
                right -= 1;
            } else {
                left += 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## **Complexity:**
- The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`.

- The extra space in this algorithm is used for storing the result, i.e. a vector of two integers, which takes `O(1)` complexity.
