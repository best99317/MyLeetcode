# [88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/) [Easy]

Given two sorted integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, merge `nums2` into `nums1` as one sorted array.

**Note:**

- The number of elements initialized in `nums1` and `nums2` are `m` and `n` respectively.
- You may assume that `nums1` has enough space (size that is greater or equal to `m` + `n`) to hold additional elements from `nums2`.

**Example:**

```
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```

**Constraints:**

- -10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^9
- nums1.length == m + n
- nums2.length == n

## **Anaylsis:**
It's easy to come up with the brute force algorithm, which is to compare the numbers in `num2` with  `num1` and insert them one by one. This would take `O(mn)` time complexity. 

Think about how can we make it faster. Can we turn this algorithm into something with `O(m+n)` complexity considering that both of the arrays are sorted? Yes, we can, by setting a pointer to the last element of each array. Through the two pointers, we can merge the two arrays from right to left: compare the pointed elements and put the bigger one to the last empty position available, and move the corresponding pointer one element left. This algorithm only traverse each of the arrays once, which takes `O(m+n)` time complexity.

## **Code:**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int> &nums1, int m, vector<int> &nums2, int n){
        int p1 = m - 1;
        int p2 = n - 1;
        while (p1 >= 0 && p2 >= 0)
        {
            if (nums1[p1] >= nums2[p2])
            {
                nums1[p1 + p2 + 1] = nums1[p1];
                p1 -= 1;
            }
            else
            {
                nums1[p1 + p2 + 1] = nums2[p2];
                p2 -= 1;
            }
        }
        // Deal with special cases: 
        // 1) No need to care for nums1 if there are some elements left when nums2 are all merged
        // 2) Need to copy what's left of nums2 to nums1 if nums2 got extra elements when done comparing
        while (p2 >= 0)
        {
            nums1[p1 + p2 + 1] = nums2[p2];
            p2 -= 1;
        }
    }
};
```

## **Complexity:**
- The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(m+n)`.

- The extra space in this algorithm is the two pointers, which takes `O(1)` complexity.
