# [1710. Ways to Split Array Into Three Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/) [Medium]

A split of an integer array is **good** if:

- The array is split into three **non-empty** contiguous subarrays - named `left`, `mid`, `right` respectively from left to right.
- The sum of the elements in `left` is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in `mid`, and the sum of the elements in `mid` is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in `right`.
  
Given `nums`, an array of **non-negative** integers, return the number of **good** ways to split `nums`. As the number may be too large, return it **modulo `109 + 7`**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only good way to split nums is [1] [1] [1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,2,5,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three good ways of splitting nums:
[1] [2] [2,2,5,0]
[1] [2,2] [2,5,0]
[1,2] [2,2] [5,0]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no good way to split nums.
```

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 104`

## **Anaylsis:**
It's easy to come up with the brute force algorithm that takes `O(n^2)` time complextiy by adding up all possible pairs. But this algorithm didn't utilize the information that the array is sorted.

The solution can be degraded to `O(n)` complexity by using two pointers. We can start from the first and the last elements of the array. If the sum of the elements is less than the target, we move the first pointer one element right; is greater then we move
the second pointer one element left.

## **Code:**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = numbers.size()-1;
        vector<int> res;
        while (left < right) {
            if (numbers[left] + numbers[right] == target) {
                res = {left+1, right+1};
                break;
            } else if (numbers[left] + numbers[right] >= target) {
                right -= 1;
            } else {
                left += 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## **Complexity:**
- The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`.

- The extra space in this algorithm is used for storing the result, i.e. a vector of two integers, which takes `O(1)` complexity.
