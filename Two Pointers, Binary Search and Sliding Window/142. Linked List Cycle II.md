# [142. Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/) [Medium]

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Note:** Do not modify the linked list.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

## **Anaylsis:**
We can use the same fast and slow pointers strategy in [porblem 141](141.%20Linked%20List%20Cycle.md) to judge whether there is a cycle or not. The fast one traverse two list nodes at a time whilst the slow one one node at a time. If there is a cycle in the list, the fast pointer should be able to come up with the slow one again through the cycle.

But the problem is how can we find where the circle starts, i.e. the `pos` node? As we have analyzed in [porblem 141](141.%20Linked%20List%20Cycle.md), the fast and slow pointer would meet again at the node `n-pos`. One important coincidence we can utilize to find `pos` is that the distance from where fast and slow meet to the `pos` node and that from head to the `pos` node are the same. Thus, all we need to do is to start two pointers that both travel one node at a time from head and the meeting point, and they shall meet at the `pos` node. 

## **Code:**
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode *fast = head;
        ListNode *slow = head;
        while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
            if (fast == slow) {
                ListNode *pos_finder = head;
                while (pos_finder != slow) {
                    pos_finder = pos_finder->next;
                    slow = slow->next;
                }
                return pos_finder;
            }
        }
        return NULL;
    }
};
```

## **Complexity:**
- If there is no cycle, it would take the fast pointer `n/2` times of moving to reach the end. If there is, it would take `n-2*pos` time for the fast and slow pointer to meet up and another `pos` time to find out the `pos` node. Thus, The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`.

- The extra space in this algorithm is used for storing the pointers, which takes `O(1)` complexity.
