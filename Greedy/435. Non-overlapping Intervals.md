# [435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/) [Medium]

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping. 

**Note:**

1. You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
2. Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.

 **Example 1:**

```
Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]

Output: 1

Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
```

 **Example 2:**

```
Input: [ [1,2], [1,2], [1,2] ]

Output: 2

Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
```

 **Example 3:**

```
Input: [ [1,2], [2,3] ]

Output: 0

Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

## **Anaylsis:**
This is one of the most classic problems, the Scheduling Problem, that is designed for greedy policy. Given that we are required to remove the least number of intervals, it is to say that we need to select as many intervals as possible.

As many may fall into the entanglement of the starting points, ending points, and the lengths of the intervals, the greedy policy is to always select the interval that ends at earliest possible point, after sorting the intervals by their ending points.

## **Code:**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // use cmp function to set the sorting criterion to the ending points.
    static bool cmp(vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
        return a[1] < b[1];
    }
    int eraseOverlapIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        int n = intervals.size();
        if (n == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        // sort the intervals based on their ending points
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), cmp);
        int select = 1;
        int cur_end = intervals[0][1];  // track the current ending points
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] >= cur_end) {
                select += 1;
                cur_end = intervals[i][1];
            }
        }
        // return the number of intervals to be removed
        return n - select;
    }
};
```

## **Complexity:**
- The time complexities of sorting the intervals is $O(nlogn)$. The time complexity of choosing the intervals with no overlap is $O(n)$. Thus, the time complexity of this algorithm is $O(nlogn)$.

- The extra space in this algorithm is used for storing some variables like $select$ and $cur_end$, which are $O(1)$ complexity. Thus, the space complexity of this algorithm is also $O(1)$.
