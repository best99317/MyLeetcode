# [135. Candy](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/) [Hard]
## **Problem Description:**
There are *N* children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

What is the minimum candies you must give?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

## **Anaylsis:**
The intuition of this problem would be to traverse the array and assign to local minimum ratings one candy and add one more to its neighbors. But one may get stuck at finding the local minimums. On one hand, they are related only to their neighbors and can not be found through sorting. On the other hand, if simply traverse the array with a greedy policy from left to right, one may not know how many candies to assign to a larger rating that comes first, because the number ratings that are less than the current one remains unknown.

But the thing is that this problem is not that complicated. The requirements of this problem is equivalent to the following:

- `ratings[i] >= 1`
- if `ratings[i] < ratings[i+1]`, then `candies[i] < candies[i+1]`
- if `ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]`, then `candies[i] > candies[i+1]`
 
In fact, the second rule can be realized by traversing greedily from left to right and third from right to left. 

Initialize all `candies[i]` to 1. First traverse from left to right. If `ratings[i] < ratings[i+1]`, then `candies[i+1] = candies[i] + 1`. Secondly, traverse from left to right. If `ratings[i-1] > ratings[i]`, then `candies[i-1] = max(candies[i] + 1, candies[i])`. Using the `max` function guarantees that the second rule still holds.


## **Code:**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        int n = ratings.size();
        vector<int> candies(n, 1);
        // traverse from left to right
        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
            if (ratings[i+1] > ratings[i]) {
                candies[i+1] = candies[i] + 1;
            }
        }
        // traverse from right to left
        for (int i = n-1; i > 0; i--) {
            if (ratings[i-1] > ratings[i]) {
                candies[i-1] = max(candies[i] + 1, candies[i-1]);
            }
        }
        // summing the number of candies together
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            res += candies[i];
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## **Complexity:**
- The time complexities of traversing from left to right, right to left and summing up the number of candies are all `O(n)`. Thus, the time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`.

- The extra space in this algorithm is used for storing the `candies` array, which is `O(n)` space complexity, and some variables like `n` and `res`, which are `O(1)` complexity. Thus, the space complexity of this algorithm is also `O(n)`.
