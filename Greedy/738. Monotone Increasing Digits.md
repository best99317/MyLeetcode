# [738. Monotone Increasing Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/monotone-increasing-digits/) [Medium]

Given a non-negative integer `N`, find the largest number that is less than or equal to `N` with monotone increasing digits.

(Recall that an integer has *monotone increasing digits* if and only if each pair of adjacent digits `x` and `y` satisfy `x <= y`.)

**Example 1:**

```
Input: N = 10
Output: 9
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: N = 1234
Output: 1234
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: N = 332
Output: 299
```

**Note:** `N` is an integer in the range `[0, 10^9]`.

## **Anaylsis:**
Through some sketchy try out, we can find the greedy policy here is that whenever a lower digit is less than its adjacent higher digit, we need to "borrow" one (minus one) from the higher digit, and turn all of the lower digits to 9.

So we can firstly turn the number into digits and count the number of digits along the way, and than traverse the digits and process them according to the greedy rule we found, and finally put them together again.

## **Code:**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int monotoneIncreasingDigits(int N) {
        int digit_num = 1;
        vector<int> digits;
        // Turn the number into digits and count the number of digits
        while (N / 10 > 0) {
            digit_num += 1;
            digits.push_back(N % 10);
            N /= 10;
        }
        digits.push_back(N);    // Don't forget boundary cases if they exist.
        int nine_pos = -1;  // Document the position where all lower digits have to turn to 9.
        for (int i = 0; i < digit_num-1; i++) {
            if (digits[i] < digits[i+1]) {
                nine_pos = i;
                digits[i] = 9;
                digits[i+1] -= 1;
            }
        }
        // Construct the result by the processed digits.
        double res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < digit_num; i++) {
            if (i < nine_pos) {
                res += 9 * pow(10, i);
            } else {
                res += digits[i] * pow(10,i);
            }
        }
        return int(res);
    }
};
```

## **Complexity:**

- The time complexities of turning the number to digits is $O(n)$, with $n$ being the number of digits of the given number. Processing the digits takes one traverse which is $O(n)$. So is constructing the result. Thus, the time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n)$.

- The extra space in this algorithm is used for storing the digits vector, which takes $O(n)$. With some extra space to store some $O(1)$ variables, the space complexity of this algorithm is $O(n)$.
