# [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/) [Easy]

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## **Anaylsis:**
My first vague thought on this problem is to buy whenever encountering a low price and sell whenever encountering a high price. Two questions came along the way:

- When encountering a consecutive increase in prices, do we buy and sell multiple times or buy once at the lowest and sell once at the highest? The answer can be found in this example: `[1,10,100,1000], 9+900 v.s. 999`.
- Do we sell at the local optima or the global optima? The answer can be found in this example: `[1,10,5,100], 9+95 v.s. 99`.

So the problem have been turned in to finding peaks and valleys where we buy and sell respectively.

## **Code:**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        // Boundary condition
        if (prices.size() == 1) return 0;
        int res = 0;
        int buy = 2147483647;   // Initialize the buying price to infinity
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.size()-1; i++) {
            if (prices[i] < prices[i+1]) {  // When found the turning valley, we buy
                buy = min(prices[i], buy);
            } else if (buy != 2147483647) { // When found the turning peak,
                res += prices[i] - buy;     // and we have already bought, 
                buy = 2147483647;           // we sell and reset the initial buying price.
            }
        }
        // One special case is that the prices never decrease so that there is no peak
        if (buy != 2147483647) res += prices[prices.size()-1] - buy;
        return res; 
    }
};
```

## **Complexity:**

- The time complexity is reflected simply in the traversing of the prices, which takes `O(n)` time. Thus, the time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`.

- The extra space in this algorithm is used for storing the two 0's and variables like `buy` and `res`, which are `O(1)` complexity. Thus, the space complexity of this algorithm is also `O(1)`.
