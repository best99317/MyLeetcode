# [56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```

## **Anaylsis:**
The solution to this problem is quite straight forward. Apparently, we need to merge the intervals with overlaps, and then we can get the result.

The first thing to do is to sort the intervals by their staring points. We can judge whether two intervals are overlapped by comparing the right end of the first interval and the left point of the second one, and merge them by updating right boundary with the right end of the second interval if the right boundary can be extended.

If we encounter an interval whose left point fall out of the previously merged boundary, then it means that we need to start a new group of merging.

## **Code:**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());
        vector<vector<int>> merged;
        for (vector<int> interval: intervals) {
            if (merged.size() == 0) merged.push_back(interval);
            else {
                if (interval[0] <= merged.back()[1]) merged.back()[1] = max(interval[1], merged.back()[1]);
                else merged.push_back(interval);
            }
        }        
        return merged;
    }
};
```

## **Complexity:**
- The time complexity of sorting the intervals is `O(nlogn)`. Traversing the sorted intervals takes `O(n)` time. Thus, the time complexity of this algorithm is `O(nlogn)`.

- The extra space in this algorithm is used for storing the merged result, which takes at most `O(n)`.
